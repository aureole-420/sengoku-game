/**
 * Implementation of a demo game to ensure the API works as expected.
 * The game will pop up an independent game GUI in the client, which notifies the player to make a guess between 1 and 100.
 * If the guess is right, server will send a congratulation message; if the guess is smaller than the right answer, the server 
 * will notify that the guess is too small; similarly if the guess is bigger than the right answer, the server will notify that
 * the guess is too big.
